The park is characterized by its diverse ecosystems, which include dense scrub jungles, open grasslands, lakes, and wetlands. Named after the numerous "villus" or natural lakes scattered across its landscape, Wilpattu is not only renowned for its biodiversity but also for its historical and cultural significance.

They can be spotted wandering through dense thickets, cooling off in natural lakes, or strolling across open grasslands.

The park's conservation efforts focus on maintaining the delicate balance between the elephant population and the surrounding ecosystem. Rangers and conservationists work diligently to monitor and protect these animals, ensuring the sustainability of this iconic species within the park.

          Visitors to Wilpattu National Park have the unique opportunity to witness these gentle giants in their natural habitat. Jeep safaris through the park provide a chance to observe elephants engaging in various behaviors, from foraging for food to bathing in the park's lakes. As with all wildlife, responsible tourism practices are essential to minimize disturbance and preserve the park's ecological integrity.

          It's important to note that wildlife populations, including elephants, can fluctuate due to factors such as habitat changes, human-wildlife conflict, and conservation initiatives. For the most up-to-date and accurate information on the elephant population in Wilpattu National Park, it's recommended to consult recent reports from the Department of Wildlife Conservation in Sri Lanka or other relevant conservation organizations.
